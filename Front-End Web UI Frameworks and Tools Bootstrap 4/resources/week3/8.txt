Let's take a look at yet another interesting component in bootstrap, called as the bootstrap carousel. The carousel allows you to display multiple items on your web page and provides an animated display of these items. As I mentioned, a carousel is an interesting component that allows you to include a slideshow on your web page, and can also provide manual controls for the slides. So, as the slides slide from left to right on your web page, you can control and choose which particular item to view, and also you can manually scroll the items left and right. Carousel finds a lot of applications in many websites that you might have visited. Let's take a look at an example of a carousel. Go into your web page, you see a carousel included on this web page. So, you see that this carousel provides interesting transitions from one slide to another, and also provides manual controls that enable you to select which item to view. So for example, you can manually scroll right and left in the carousel. You can also select an item from the carousel using these indicators that are provided at the bottom of the carousel. I'm sure you have seen many websites using this kind of component. Now that I have gotten you interested in the carousel, I'm sure you're curious about how you create one for your web page. That is what we're going to examine in this next exercise, where we will add a carousel to our web page, the index.html page and then create the manual controls for it.
