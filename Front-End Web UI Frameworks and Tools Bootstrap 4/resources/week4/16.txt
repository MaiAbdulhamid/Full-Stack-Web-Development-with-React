[MUSIC] As we come to the conclusion of this
course, it's time to look back and reflect about what we've
covered in this course so far. And what is the way forward from this course towards the other
courses of this specialization. Looking back at the big picture
view of full stack web development. We have started out our journey by looking
at the front-end web UI frameworks, in particular, Bootstrap 4,
in this course. We will cover the remaining parts of
the full stack web development stack in the rest of the courses
of this specialization. In this course,
we covered Bootstrap in great detail. We looked at responsive web design and how the Bootstrap grid system enables
us to achieve responsive websites. We also looked at various Bootstrap CSS
and JavaScript components. Along the way, we learned how to
operate within the Node ecosystem for doing development. We learned web tools like Git,
and we installed Node and learned about the NPM package manager. We also learned about task
runners like Grunt and Gulp. And learned how to set up NPM scripts for automating frequently performed
tasks in web development. As we move towards the next
course of the specialization, in the next course we'll be
concentrating on Javascript frameworks. So this is the other piece
of the puzzle on front-end. So together with UI frameworks,
the Javascript frameworks facilitate development of dynamic websites,
especially the front-end. We'll look at the remaining parts,
including hybrid development and server-side, in the remaining
courses of the specialization. I hope you enjoyed going
through this course. And I hope I'll see you back again in
the next course of the specialization. [MUSIC]
